- Favorite project/internship that you have had?
  - Why? What was the toughest thing of the project?

- You have a 100 story building and phone making company gives you only two phones and wants to know at what floor will the phone break?
  - No time constraints only care about accuracy, how would you find that floor?
  - Now they want you to test a bunch of phones so they want a faster way but obviously still accurate how would you improve your method if any?
