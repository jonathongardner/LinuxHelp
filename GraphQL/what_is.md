# GraphQL
A query language for APIs

REST you have routes and each route returns different data (sometimes params can be added to filter, return more data, etc.)

REST vs GraphQL
  - Accessing Data
    - Rest: routes
    - GraphQL: one endpoint different query objects

  - Verbs
    - Rest: GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE
    - GraphQL: one verb (POST) query types query (default) and mutation
